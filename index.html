            <div class="con-text1">
                <p>The teenage pregnancy rate in the Philippines was 10%
                    in 2008, down to 9% in 2017. Live births by teenage
                    mothers (aged 10-19) in 2016 totalled 203,085, which
                    slightly decreased to 196,478 in 2017 and 183,000 in
                    2018. Still, the Philippines has one of the highest
                    adolescent birth rates among the ASEAN Member States.
                    Recent World Bank data shows that the Philippines has
                    47 births annually per 1,000 women aged 15-19, higher   
                    than the average adolescent birth rates of 44 globally
                    and 33.5 in the ASEAN region [cf. Lao PDR (76), Cambodia
                    (57), Indonesia (48) and Thailand (43)]. This entails that
                    more than 500 Filipino adolescent girls are getting
                    pregnant and giving birth every day. UNFPA echoes the
                    sense of urgency demonstrated by NEDA and POPCOM,
                    which recently described the still alarmingly high teenage
                    pregnancy rate in the country as a “national emergenc.</p>
                <br>
                <p>It is also crucial to note that out of live births within the
                    15-19 age group, which comprised 11.4% of all live
                    births, only 3% is fathered by men of the same age group
                    (PSA-CRSV, 2017). This data suggests that teenage
                    pregnancies among girls among the 15-19 years old may
                    be a result of coercion and unequal power relations
                    between girls and older men. The 2015 Baseline Study
                    on Violence Against Children also reinforced this and
                    further highlighted that verbal insistence and emotional
                    blackmail are the usual forms of sexual coercion in
                    dating relationships.
                    
                    </p>
                <br>
                <p>All levels of the government have the
                    responsibility to ensure that adolescent and
                    youth populations enjoy the highest attainable
                    standard of health and access to quality health
                    services including SRH. Adolescents and youth
                    deserve to enjoy the full extent of their rights
                    and the ‘triple dividend’ of improving their
                    health now, their lives in the future, and the
                    next generation by investing in their health.
                    There are examples of countries within Asia
                    and the Pacific, which are enacting laws and
                    policies that among others, seek to recognize
                    the evolving capacities of youth, facilitate
                    access to sexuality and reproductive health
                    information and services, protect against
                    discrimination and stigma, and recognize
                    privacy rights.

                <p>Increasing adolescent and youth resilience
                    and protection. Contrary to popular belief,
                    there is no evidence that shows sexuality
                    education programs lead to early sexual debut
                    or increased sexual activity. CSE is the
                    cornerstone of improving the SRH of young
                    people.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In order to make healthy, responsible
                    decisions, young people need accurate
                    information about puberty, reproduction,
                    relationships, sexuality, the consequences of
                    unsafe sex, and how to avoid HIV, STIs, and
                    unintended pregnancy. They also need the
                    skills and confidence to be able to deal with
                    peer pressure and negotiate safe and
                    consensual relationships. CSE programs that
                    address the above situations have been
                    proven not only to have a positive impact on
                    knowledge and attitudes, but also to
                    contribute to safer sexual practices (such as
                    delaying sexual debut, reducing the number of
                    partners, and increasing condom and
                    contraceptive use). Moreover, CSE can also
                    reduce the negative consequences of unsafe
                    sex.</p>
